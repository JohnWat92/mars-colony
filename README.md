# MarsColony

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.0.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## What I Used
In this project I used typescript and angular mainly to code for my different views to create a Mars Colony app that can display information and also post a new colonist or encounter to the json url as well which can be seen using postman. It was really interesting to see us being able to update a json file through user inputs.

I had some difficulty with trying to reverse the ngfor loop with a pipe so i could display the list of encounters to the latest update so the user doesn't have to scroll down. I tried using in the pipe file with .slice().reverse(), but it doesn't seem to recognize .slice(). 

overall It was a really interesting project becuase of how practical it is to be able to update a file through a mobile app.
